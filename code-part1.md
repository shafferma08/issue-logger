The `updateActiveIssues` function is used to add a new issue to the list of active issues stored in the browser's localStorage.

- It takes an `issue` object as an argument. The `issue` object is expected to contain details about the issue, but it may not yet have an `id`.

- `const issues = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('issueLogger.issues') || "[]")` retrieves the current list of issues from localStorage. If there are no issues stored yet, it defaults to an empty array (`[]`).

- The `while (!issue.id)` loop is used to generate a unique id for the issue. It continues generating random numbers until it finds one that doesn't match an id of an existing issue.

   - `const issueID = Math.floor(Math.random() * 99999)` generates a random number between 0 and 99999.

   - `if (issues.find((item) => item.id === issueID))` checks if there's already an issue with the generated id. If there is, it continues to the next iteration of the loop, generating a new random id.

   - `issue.id = issueID` assigns the generated id to the `issue` if it's unique.

- `const issueWithId = issue` assigns the `issue` object (now with a unique id) to `issueWithId`.

- `issues.push(issueWithId)` adds the new issue to the array of existing issues.

- `localStorage.setItem('issueLogger.issues', JSON.stringify(issues))` updates the issues stored in localStorage with the new array of issues, including the new issue. 

- Finally, `return issueWithId` returns the new issue object, now including its unique id.

Overall, this function is used to generate a unique id for a new issue, add the new issue to the existing list of issues, and update the list of issues in localStorage.
